            <p class="intro-text"><em>When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least if anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written.</em></p>

        <div class="conclusion-text-part1">
            <p>A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you</p>
        </div>
        <div><p class="conclusion-text-stop"><em>stop</em></p></div>
        <div class="conclusion-container2">
            <p class="conclusion-text-part2">and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a <em>breath</em> well you are always taking a <em>breath</em> and why emphasize one <em>breath</em> rather than another <em>breath.</em></div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Anyway that is the way I felt about it and I felt that about it <em>very very</em> strongly. And so I almost never used a comma.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">The longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more the very more I had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.</div>
        <div class="q-container2"><em>So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in</em> poetry <em>it is a little different but more so and later I will go into that.</em></div>
        <div class="conclusion-text-part3">But that is the way I felt about</div>
        <div class="punctuation">?<br>!<br>&#146<br>:<br>;<br>,<br>.</div>
        <div class="conclusion-text-part4"><em>punctuation</em> in prose.</div>

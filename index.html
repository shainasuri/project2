Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark.</a></p></div>

            <div class="index"><p class="index-scroll-2"><a href="2-apostrophe.html">One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it.</a></p></div>

            <div class="index"><p class="index-scroll-3"><a href="3-colons.html">I still do feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods to do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with writing.</a></p></div>

            <div class="index"><p class="index-scroll-4"><a href="4-verbs.html">Verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.</a></p></div>

            <div class="index"><p class="index-scroll-5"><a href="5-conclusion.html">When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least if anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written.</a></p></div>

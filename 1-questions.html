            <p class="intro-text"><em>There are some</em> punctuations <em>that are interesting and there are some</em> punctuations <em>that are not.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. </div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark.</div>
            <div><img src="./graphics/Asset-10.png" class="qe-graphics"></div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">The question mark is alright when it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">It is evident that is you ask a question you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer"><em>Therefore I ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.</em></div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something.</div>
        <div class="q-container2">A <em>question</em> is a <em>question</em> anybody can know that a <em>question</em> is a <em>question</em> and so why add to it the <em>question</em> mark when it is already there when the <em>question</em> is already there in the writing.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.</div>
            <div><img src="./graphics/Asset-11.png" class="qe-graphics"></div>
        <div class="q-container2"><em>Exclamation marks </em>have the same difficulty and also <em>quotation marks, </em>they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a <em>question is a question </em>what is the use of its being a <em>question.</em> </div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">The same thing is true of a quotation.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">Perhaps someday they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that.</div>
        <div class="q-textcontainer">There are besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting.</div>
        <div class="q-container3">They might if one felt that way about them.</div>
